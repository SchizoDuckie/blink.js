Bringing &lt;blink> back to the browser

So, FireFox 23 has dropped support for our beloved <blink> tag. OH NOES!

This little script brings <blink> back to life, disco disco, party!!

Currently, this fix only applies to FireFox

Todo
----
* Add support for .blink()
* Add support for text-decoration: blink;
* Add support to other browsers that killed <blink>
